# Roomies!

This is a quick project I made to facilitate finding roommates at Carnegie Mellon University, for students old and anew.

Suggestions and bug reports are greatly appreciated.

# How To Run:

- If there's a version mismatch with node, run nvm install (version type)
Then run
...
yarn install
yarn prisma generate
yarn run dev
